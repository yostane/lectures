    "- In Python, identifiers (variable name, function name, class name, etc.) for variables and functions that contain multiple words are seperated with an underscore `_`. This technique is called snake case and it is a recommendation.\n",
    "- We usually give longer names for identifiers for the sake of clarity.\n",
    "- **Snake case**: seperate multiple words in an identifier with an underscrore.\n",
    "  - Example: `even_count`, `random_integer`, `player_guess`, `player_first_guess`, etc.\n",
    "- **Camel case**: seperate multiple words in an identifier with a captial letter\n",
    "  - Example: `evenCount`, `randomInteger`, `playerGuess`, `playerFirstGuess`, etc.\n",
    "- **Kebab case**: separate words with `-` (dash, tiret in french). This is usually not used in programming, but for file names and URLs (web site address).\n",
    "  - Example: `junia-learning.com`"
