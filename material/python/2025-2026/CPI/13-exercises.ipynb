The program asks the user to **input** the name of his entrée, then, the name of his main course, then the name of his dessert. Store the order in a dictionary with keys `\"entrée\"`, `\"main course\"`, and `\"dessert\"`. Next (the improevement), the program asks the user if he wants to add a drink to his order (yes/no). If the user answers \"yes\", the program asks for the name of the drink and adds it to the order dictionary with the key `\"drink\"`. Next (another improvement), the program shows the summary of the order and asks the user to confirme (yes/no). If the user answers \"no\", the program allows the user to modify his order by re-inputting the entrée, main course, dessert, and optionally drink.
